## Schedule
This is an application to model a Scheduler, similar to a standard calendar. However, the Scheduler functions differently since it asks for how long an event will last, rather than when it starts and end. It shows exactly where the event can fit in the schedule, allowing for better planning for fitting tasks into a day.
